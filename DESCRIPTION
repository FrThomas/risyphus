Authors@R: c(person("Fridtjof", "Thomas", email = "fthomas4@uthsc.edu", role = c("aut", "cre")))
Description: Tools/utility functions for studies with typically two groups.

    can be automated to some extend and risyphus collects a few
    such automations, e.g., compiling a so called baseline-table when two groups/study arms are considered.
