Description: This package contains functions that facilitate laborious steps
    in most data analysis tasks, such as basic variable description,
    compilation of baseline tables comparing two groups, odds-ratio tables
    based on logistic regression, or hazard-ratio tables based on
    Cox proportional hazards models. The name of this package is derived
    from the Greek mythological figure Sisyphus (Sisyphus for R = risyphus),
    who was doomed to roll a big boulder up a hill just to see it roll down
    again ad infinitum. Somehow I related to the laborious task of keeping all
    standard tables up to date in a developing project as Sisyphean, and it all
    too often consumed too much time and energy devoted to a project. My
    intention with this package is to do standard tasks well and to free time
    and resources for better statistical analyses and to facilitate
    reproducible computing.
